 - remove the need for AllDirectoriesExist and add calls to mkdir in test setup.
 
 - res = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &on, sizeof(on)) seems with no effect on TCPIP sockets 
   look and fix if possible.
   
 - test read over closed socket should return 0 : fixed but found another :
 
 - When you try to Connect a TCPIP socket over a not open port  the connect never failed but block forever.
 
 - correct the /dev/random emulation in order to not use real device but NS3 random methods
 
 - fix uname --> see ns3/examples/naming
 
 - utils.cc TimeBase: add possibility to change the start date of the Simulation ! 
  
  
 Some ideas:

  - option: have the NS3 time for file attributs in place of the real time,

      
EXEC: do not assert when executable is not found, and use virtual PATH env or real ?      
EXEC: fix stdout and stderr ,flushing bugs.
